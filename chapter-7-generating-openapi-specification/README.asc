Documenting how our application works and showing what our API *expects* and
*returns*, is a vital part of most application documentations. This is
especially true, if you are exposing an external Software Developer Kit (or
SDK).

One great tool to automate this entire process is *Swagger*.

In these next lesson. We'll be looking at how we can integrate and automatically
generate "OpenAPI - documentation" for our NestJS applications.

We'll be taking advantage of all the latest tools and Nest "plugin" to help
automate and simplify every aspect of the process. Let's jump right in.

image::./images/chapter-7-2.png[align="center"]
//}}}

One of the best ways to document our application is to use the "OpenAPI
- Specification".  The "OpenAPI - Specification" is a language agnostic
definition format used to describe a "RESTful APIs".

//{{{ image::./images/chapter-7-3.png
[#img-chapter]
[link=./images/chapter-7-3.png]
.Introducing the Swagger Module -3
image::./images/chapter-7-3.png[align="center"]
//}}}

An "OpenAPI - document" allows us to describe our entire API including:

- Available *operations* or endpoints.
- *Operation parameter*: input and output for each operation.
- *Authentication* methods.
- *Contact information*, license, terms of use, and other information and much
  more.

Nest provides a dedicated Module which allows us to generate such an "OpenAPI
- document" simply by "*leveraging decorators*".

To get this module installed in our application. Let's first make sure we have
the necessary dependencies installed.

We'll be installing `"@nestjs/swagger"`, `"swagger-ui-express"`, since our
application is using the default platform ExpressJS.  Just know that if you've
switched your "Nest - application" to use "Fastify" install `"fastify-swagger"`
instead.

//{{{ $ npm i --save @nestjs/swagger swagger-ui-express
[source, shell]
----
$ npm i --save @nestjs/swagger swagger-ui-express
----
//}}}

We'll continue ahead as we already have these packages installed, but if you're
following along just pause in a second and come back when it's finished.

Once `"@nestjs/swagger"` and our applications relevant Swagger installation is
complete. Let's open up our `main.ts` - file and start setting up swagger by
generating a *base* *"documentation"* which will be the "base - object" where
our "OpenAPI - document" is contained.

//{{{  main.ts
[source, typescript]
----
// main.ts
import { NestFactory } from "@nestjs/core";
import { ValidationPipe } from "@nestjs/common";
import { DocumentBuilder, SwaggerModule } from "@nestjs/swagger";

import { AppModule } from "./app.module";

async function bootstrap() {
    const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);

    app.useGlobalPipes(
        new ValidationPipe({
        }),
    );
    const options = new DocumentBuilder()
        .setTitle("Iluvcoffee")
        .setDescription("Coffee Application")
        .setVersion("0.1")
        .build();

    const document = SwaggerModule.createDocument(app, options);
    SwaggerModule.setup("api", app, document);

    await app.listen(3002);
}
bootstrap();
----
//}}}

`"DocumentBuilder"` from the `@nestjs/swagger` - package, helps us structure
a base document that conforms to the OpenAPI Specification. It provides several
methods that allow us to set such properties as: "title", "description",
"version" etc.

Next. Let's use these options to create the full document with all "HTTP
- Routes" - defined.  Let's start by importing `"SwaggerModule"` from
  `@nestjs/swagger`; and call the `"createDocument()"` - method passing *in* our
  "application instance", and the "Swagger `options` - Object", we just created.

Now that we've created a document we can call the `"SwaggerModule.setup()"`
- method to wire everything together. This method accepts a few parameter
including:

- "Route - path" to mount the Swagger UI to.
- "Application - Instance".
- "Document - Object" we just instantiated above.

With all of this in place we can now run our application to see if everything
worked.

//{{{ $ npm run start:dev
[source, shell]
----
$ npm run start:dev
----
//}}}

Once the application finishes building and it's up and running.

Let's open up our browser and navigate to `"localhost/3002/api"`.

//{{{ image::./images/chapter-7-4.png
[#img-chapter]
[link=./images/chapter-7-4.png]
.Introducing the Swagger Module -4
image::./images/chapter-7-4.png[align="center"]
//}}}

This is the "Route - path" that we put in the fist parameter of our
`"Swagger.setup("api")"`, and look there we have it. We should see the "Swagger
- UI".

As we can see the `SwaggerModule` automatically reflects all of our endpoints
and we can see them all listed here.

//{{{ image::./images/chapter-7-5.png
[#img-chapter]
[link=./images/chapter-7-5.png]
.Introducing the Swagger Module -5
image::./images/chapter-7-5.png[align="center"]
//}}}

But it seems like a lot of information about each endpoint is missing. Let's
take a loot at how we can fix that in the next few lesson.

//{{{ image::./images/chapter-7-7.png
[#img-chapter]
[link=./images/chapter-7-7.png]
.Enabling CLI Plugin
image::./images/chapter-7-7.png[align="center"]
//}}}

If we look at the "Swagger - UI", and toggle for example the `create()` POST
- endpoint tab.  We'll notice that there's no information on what "Request
- Body" is *expecting* to properly create a new "Coffees - resources".

How do we know what shape of an object is expected by this specific POST action
in order to successfully add a "new - Coffee", if we don't have any information
provided to us in the "Swagger - UI"?

If we look at our application code, we actually have a dedicated "DTO - class"
that represent the "input API" for this endpoint.

//{{{  create-coffee.dto.ts
[source, typescript]
----
// create-coffee.dto.ts
import { IsString } from "class-validator";

export class CreateCoffeeDto {
    @IsString()
    readonly name: string;

    @IsString()
    readonly brand: string;

    @IsString({ each: true })
    readonly flavors: string[];
}
----
//}}}

But unfortunately, this in not enough to automatically gereate the "OpenAPI
- schemas" out of the box.

TypeScript's - "metadata reflection system" has several *limitations* which make
it impossible to for instance: "determine what properties a class consist of, or
recognize whether a given property is *optional* or *required*".

However some of these constraints can be addressed at "*compilation*" time. Nest
provides a plugin that enhances the "TypeScript - compilation" to reduce the
amount of boilerplate code we'd be required to create in order to tackle this
problem.

Note that this plugin is "opt-in". If you prefer you can declare all of the
"Swagger - decorators" *manually* OR (recommended) add specific decorators
wherever you need to *override* the base functionality provided by the plugin.

To enable this new "Swagger - CLI" *plugin*, Simply open up the
*"nest-cli.json"* - file, and add the following "compiler - options"
- configuration.

//{{{ nest-cli.json
[source, typescript]
----
// nest-cli.json
{
  "collection": "@nestjs/schematics",
  "sourceRoot": "src",
  "compilerOptions": {
      "deleteOutDir": true,
      "plugins": ["@nestjs/swagger/plugin"]
  }
}
----
//}}}

You can see we're including the `"@nestjs/swagger"` - plugin in the `"plugin:
[]"` Array here.

Let's save our changes and fire up the terminal.

To make sure that the `"swagger/plugin"` is properly loaded by the compiler.
Let's terminate the process and rerun the `*"build"*` in development mode with:
(`$ npm run star:dev`).

Once the application is ready, let's head back to the browser and refresh the
"Swagger - UI" page.

//{{{ image::./images/chapter-7-8.png
[#img-chapter]
[link=./images/chapter-7-8.png]
.Enabling CLI Plugin -2
image::./images/chapter-7-8.png[align="center"]
//}}}

Now we can see that the UI actually reflects the "CreateCoffeeDto" with all of
its properties!.

The `@nestjs/swagger` - plugin was able to do all of the heavy lifting for us.
Determining all of the properties here at "*compilation* - time". We didn't have
to lift a finger!.

Next let's toggle the PATCH - endpoint and see if it properly reflects the
"UpdateCoffeeDto".

//{{{ image::./images/chapter-7-9.png
[#img-chapter]
[link=./images/chapter-7-9.png]
.Enabling CLI Plugin -2
image::./images/chapter-7-9.png[align="center"]
//}}}

It looks like Swagger was *not* able to reflect this "DTO - property" and for
some reason as we can see, there are *no* properties specified here in the
Schema.

To fix this, let's head over to the "UpdateCoffeeDto" - file, and make sure
we're importing `"PartialType"` from the `"@nestjs/swagger"` - package instead
of the `"@nestjs/mapped-types"` - package.

//{{{  update-coffee.dto.ts
[source, typescript]
----
// update-coffee.dto.ts
import { PartialType } from "@nestjs/swagger";
//                                   ~~~~~~
import { CreateCoffeeDto } from "./create-coffee.dto";

export class UpdateCoffeeDto extends PartialType(CreateCoffeeDto) {}
----
//}}}

This change helps achieve the same functionality, while instructing Swagger that
these are all in fact "*optional*" - properties.

Let's save the changes, switch back to the browser and refresh the page. Great
there we have it.  Every property is now marked as "optional" as it should be!.

As we can see the `@nestjs/swagger` - plugin not only help us tackle tough
issues.  But even figured out almost everything about our endpoints.

Without the plugin, we would have had to put *decorators* on top of *EVERYTHING*
and specified every piece of information, about each item!.

The "Swagger - plugin" automates all of this, but still gives us the ability to
*override* any little thing we want, if we need to.
