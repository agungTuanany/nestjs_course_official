== What is NestJS?
:fn-chapter_1: xref:./chapter-1-getting-started/README.asc
:fn-chapter_7: xref:./chapter-7-generating-openapi-specification/README.asc

The Web development technology tremendously change very quick. NestJS gain the
popularity contraction in *2020*.

I take some quote from official NestJS website:

[NOTE]
Nest (NestJS) is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js
server-side applications. It uses progressive JavaScript, is built with and
fully supports TypeScript (yet still enables developers to code in pure
JavaScript) and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP
(Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).

Nest itself is a framework with *platform agnostic*. It's not depend to any
architecture design, Not only to HTTP frameworks such as *ExpressJS* or
*Fastify* but even agnostic across different types of applications.

In simple word, Nest teach you how to build your apps that can runs equally
well across more than one specific design system architecture.

[NOTE]
*NodeJS* by design has a minimalistic setup, and developers are in charge of
setting up *_everything_* they want to use for their application.

NestJS provides an out of the box the application architecture that allows
developer and to create *highly testable*, *scalable*, *loosely coupled*, and
*easily maintainable application*. You can read more in
{fn-chapter_1}[chapter-1,window=_blank]

== How good is NestJS?

As a software - engineer it's so painful to create a documentation for your
software product. With Nest it easier to write clean and clear documentation
related to API documentation. You can read more in
{fn-chapter_7}[chapter-7,window=_blank].

That is one of the reasons why I wanted to learn Nestjs deeply and
fundamentally to find out what could be implemented with Nest.

You want to know more about the advantages with Nest. Check below, why *I write
this course*.

== Why You Write all This?

I wrote all this course with the samples in every chapter and project, cause I
know someday in next years I've to repeat what I read. If I repeat myself by
watching video over and over again without writing it, I'm only *renting* the
knowledge, *not owning it*.

This course is have 9 - chapter.
