Automated testing is considered an essential part of any serious software
development effort.  Automation makes it easier to repeat "individual - tests",
or "test - suits" -quickly during development.

With NestJS we can use any testing framework we prefer. However it can be quite
tedious to set everything up. Luckily for us Nest provides a built-in
integration with the "*Jest*" - testing framework out of the box, so we don't
have to do anything to get started.

"*Jest*" is a delightful JavaScript testing framework with a focus on
simplicity.  It allows you to write test with an approachable, familiar, and
feature rich API that gives you result quickly.

"*Jest*" provides great "Error - messages" and built-in Mocking utilities, to
make testing your applications much simpler. Also it reliably *run test in
"parallel"*.

To make tests run *even faster*, "*Jest*" runs previously failed test first, and
then reorganizes test runs, based on how long "Test - file" take.

In NestJS applications, we use "*Jest*" to run "*unit* - tests" and
"*end-to-end* - tests"

There are several command you can use to run "*specific test*",

- `npm run test`, for unit tests
- `npm run test:cov`, for unit test and collecting testing coverage
- `npm run test:e2e`, for end-to-end tests

With nest. We automatically have all of this power with no additional setup
needed!.

So far in this course we haven't paid too much attention to *"testing"*.  Thus,
some of the existing, or automatically generated tests may *fail*.

In the next few lesson. We'll introduce you to the "*Jest*" framework. Show you
how to use NestJS - "testing - utilities", and fix some of the existing "test
- file" - all step by step.
