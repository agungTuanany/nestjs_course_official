This chapter is a continuation of {fn-link_chapter_2}[chapter-2: creating a rest
API application] which is part of the *standard path* of this course. There's
also a bonus NoSQL MongoDB chapter{fn-link_chapter_9_} that begins right where
Chapter Two left off as well.

If you want to code along through both of these database chapters. Make sure
you save your progress from this last chapter, into separate branch. This way
you can use it later for the MongoDB bonus chapter. If you using Git, make sure
to create a new Branch to store your current progress, and then head back to
your *master* - branch to continue along with this PostgreSQL and TypeORM
- chapter, as well as the rest of the course.

By fracturing these SQL and NoSQL section, you can easily choose and watch
whichever section you need for your project, or code along through both.
