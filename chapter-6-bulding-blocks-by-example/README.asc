As we've seen throughout the course so far. In NestJS - applications everything
has its place.

This "structured - application" organization, helps us mange complexity and
develop with SOLID principles.

This Type of organization is, especially useful as the size of our application
or team grows.  Keeping code organized, establishing clear boundaries, and
having dedicated architectural building blocks, all with the separate of
responsibilities. Help us make sure that our application remain easily
maintainable and scalable over time.

In NestJS we have *4* additional "building blocks" for features, that we haven't
showcased yet!. These are:

- xref:_exception_filters[*Exception Filters*]
- xref:_pipes[*Pipes*]
- xref:_guards[*Guards*]
- xref:_interceptor[*Interceptor*]

[[_exception_filters]]
=== Exception Filters

//{{{ image::./images/chapter-6-4.png
[#img-chapter]
[link=./images/chapter-6-4.png]
.Introducing More Bulding Blocks - Exception Filters
image::./images/chapter-6-4.png[align="center"]
//}}}

*Exception Filters* are responsible for handling and processing "*unhandled -
exception*" that *might* occur in our application.  They let us control the
"Exact - flow" and "Content - flow" of any or *specific Responses*, we send back
to the client.

[[_pipes]]
=== Pipes
:fn-acl: footnote:acl[Access Control List]
:fn-aop: footnote:aop[In computing, aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns.It does so by adding additional behavior to existing code (an advice) without modifying the code itself, instead separately specifying which code is modified via a "pointcut" specification, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming]

//{{{ image::./images/chapter-6-5.png
[#img-chapter]
[link=./images/chapter-6-5.png]
.Introducing More Bulding Blocks - Pipe
image::./images/chapter-6-5.png[align="center"]
//}}}

*Pipes* are typically useful to handle *2* - things:

- *Transition*, meaning to transform "*input* - data" to *"desired output"*, and
- *Validation*, meaning to *"evaluate input data"* and if VALID - let it pass
  through the "Pipe" unchanged. But if "*NOT* - VALID", throwing an Exception.

[[_guards]]
=== Guards

//{{{ image::./images/chapter-6-6.png
[#img-chapter]
[link=./images/chapter-6-6.png]
.Introducing More Bulding Blocks - Guards
image::./images/chapter-6-6.png[align="center"]
//}}}

*Guards* determine whether a given Request meets certain condition, like
*"authentication"*, *"authorization"*, *"roles"*, *"ACLs{fn-acl}"*, etc. And if
the conditions are met, the requests will be *allowed* to access the *route*.

[[_interceptor]]
=== Interceptor

//{{{ image::./images/chapter-6-7.png
[#img-chapter]
[link=./images/chapter-6-7.png]
.Introducing More Bulding Blocks - Interceptor
image::./images/chapter-6-7.png[align="center"]
//}}}

*Interceptor* have many useful capabilities inspired by the "Aspect Oriented
Programming{fn-aop} - technique". Interceptors make it possible to:

1. Bind *extra logic*, before or after method execution.
2. Transform the *result* returned from a method.
3. Extend "*basic - method*" behavior.
4. Completely "*override* a method", depending on specific conditions. For
example: handling something like *"caching - responses"*.

So now that we've covered the basics. Let's dive into all *4* these new building
blocks in the next few lessons.

.Understanding Building Techniques

//}}}

Before we jump into the specifics of each Nest "building - block". Let's take a step back and talk about a few
approaches we can take to bind any of these "building - blocks", to different parts of our application.

//{{{ image::./images/chapter-6-9.png
[#img-chapter]
[link=./images/chapter-6-9.png]
.Understanding Building Techniques - 2
image::./images/chapter-6-9.png[align="center"]
//}}}

Basically there are *3* different ways of binding to our "*route - handlers*"
with a bonus "4th" way that specific to (*Pipes*).

- *Filters*
- *Guards*
- *Interceptors*
- *Pipes*

Nest "building - blocks" can be:

- *Globally* - scoped
- *Controller* - scoped
- *Method* - scoped
- *Param* - scope, which said is *available to Pipes* only.

NOTE: These different "binding - techniques" give you *granularity* and
*control* at different levels in you application.

Each one does NOT *override* another, but rather "*layers each one* - "on top".

So be *careful* on how you implement these.

For example, if you have a *globally*-"scoped - Pipe", it will be applied as
well as any other (Pipe) you might add. Whether it's "controlled - scoped",
"method - scoped", etc.

So far in this course we've already seen *globally*-"scoped - pipes" in action,
when we use the "ValidationPipe" to helps us validate *incoming* - "request
- payloads", amongst other things.

If we open up our `"main.ts"` - file.

//{{{ // main.ts
[source, typescript]
----
// main.ts
import { NestFactory } from "@nestjs/core";
import { ValidationPipe } from "@nestjs/common";
import { AppModule } from "./app.module";

async function bootstrap() {
    const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);

    app.useGlobalPipes(         // <<<
        new ValidationPipe({
            whitelist: true,
            transform: true,
            forbidNonWhitelisted: true,
            transformOptions: {
                enableImplicitConversion: true,
            },
        }),
    );
    await app.listen(3002);

    // console.log("app is run on port: 3002");
}
bootstrap();
----
//}}}

We'll see that we previously bound the "ValidationPipe" globally by calling
`*"useGlobalPipes()"*` - method of our "*`"app"`* - instance".

//{{{ image::./images/chapter-6-10.png
[#img-chapter]
[link=./images/chapter-6-10.png]
.Understanding Building Techniques - intellisence
image::./images/chapter-6-10.png[align="center"]
//}}}

You could see that if we type `app.use` *"intellisence"* shows us corresponding
methods for every other "building - block" available here. Respectively
`*"useGlobalPipes()"*`, `*"useGlobalGuard()"*`, `*"useGlobalInterceptors()"*`,
and `*"useGlobalFilters()"*`, etc..

Going back to our `"ValidationPipe()"` here. One big limitation of setting it up
and instantiating it by ourselves like this, is that we can *NOT* - "*inject any
dependencies*" here!. Since we're setting it up *outside* of context of any
"NestJS - *Module*".

So how do we work around this?.

One option we have, is to *set up* a *"Pipe"* directly from inside a "Nest
- *Module*" using the *"custom - provider"* based syntax, we saw in earlier lessons.

Let's open up our "AppModule" - file, and define something called the `"APP_PIPE"` - Provider.

//{{{ app.module.ts
[source, typescript]
----
// app.module.ts
import { Module, ValidationPipe } from "@nestjs/common";
import { APP_PIPE } from "@nestjs/core";
...
...

@Module({
    imports: [
        ...
        ...
    ],
    controllers: [AppController],
    providers: [
        AppService,
        {
            provide: APP_PIPE,          // <<<
            useClass: ValidationPipe,   // <<<<
        },
    ],
})
export class AppModule {}
----
//}}}

This `"APP_PIPE"` - "provider" is a "*special* - TOKEN" exported from
`"@nestjs/core"` - packages.

Providing - `"ValidationPipe"` in this manner. Let's Nest instantiate the
`"ValidationPipe"` within the *scope* of the "AppModule" and once created,
registers it as a "Global Pipe".

Note that there are also "corresponding - tokens" for every other "building
- block" feature!, such as `*"APP_INTERCEPTOR"*`, `*"APP_GUARD"*`, and
`*"APP_FILTER"*`.

Back to our `"ValidationPipe"`. What if we *don't* want to use it globally? But
some are more specific like on a "certain - Controller".

Let's imagine that we want to *bind* a `"ValidationPipe"` to *every* - "route
handler" defined only within our "CoffeesController".

Let's open up our "CoffeesController" - file and make use a new decorator
`"@UsePipes()"` that we haven't seen yet.

//{{{ coffees.controller.ts
[source, typescript]
----
// coffees.controller.ts
import { Controller, Get, Param, Body, Post, Patch, Delete, Query, Inject, UsePipes, ValidationPipe } from "@nestjs/common";

@UsePipes(ValidationPipe)           // <<<
@Controller("coffees")
export class CoffeesController {
    constructor(
        private readonly coffeesService: CoffeesService,
        @Inject(REQUEST)
        private readonly request: Request,
    ) {
        console.log("[!!] CoffeesController created");
    }
    ...
    ...
}
----
//}}}

This `@UsePipes()` decorator can be passed in a "single - Pipe Class" or
a "comma separated list of Pipe - Classes".  Just like in other scenarios.

There are also "corresponding - decorators" for every other "building - block"
that can be used here as well.  Named `*"@UseInterceptors()"*`,
`*"@UseGuards()"*`, and `*"@UseFilters()"*`.

//{{{ coffees.controller.ts
[source, typescript]
----
// coffees.controller.ts
import { Controller, Get, Param, Body, Post, Patch, Delete, Query, Inject, UsePipes, ValidationPipe } from "@nestjs/common";

@UsePipes(new ValidationPipe())     // <<<
@Controller("coffees")
export class CoffeesController {
    constructor(
        private readonly coffeesService: CoffeesService,
        @Inject(REQUEST)
        private readonly request: Request,
    ) {
        console.log("[!!] CoffeesController created");
    }
    ...
    ...
}
----
//}}}

Alternatively, you can even pass an *"instance"* of class here. Take for example
providing `"new ValidationPipe()"` inside of the decorator.

This is super useful when you want to pass in a specific - "configuration
object" to the `"ValidationPipe"` for *this* exact scenario.

NOTE: As the best practice, try to apply *"filters'* by using *"classes"*
instead of *"instances"* whenever possible.

This best practice *"reduces memory usage"* since Nest can easily *reuse
instances* of the "same class", across your entire Module.

All "building - blocks" can also be *"Method - scoped"*. Imagine that you want to
bind a "Pipe" to a "specific - Route". We can achieve this by simply applying
the same decorator we just saw `"@UsePipes()"`, but on top of the specific method we
want to declare it on.

Let's say we want to add "specific validation" to our GET - `findALL()` - method,
within "CoffeesController".

//{{{ coffees.controller.ts
[source, typescript]
----
// coffees.controller.ts
import { Controller, Get, Param, Body, Post, Patch, Delete, Query, Inject, UsePipes, ValidationPipe } from "@nestjs/common";

@Controller("coffees")
export class CoffeesController {
    constructor(
        private readonly coffeesService: CoffeesService,
        @Inject(REQUEST)
        private readonly request: Request,
    ) {
        console.log("[!!] CoffeesController created");
    }

    @UsePipes(new ValidationPipe())     // <<<
    @Get()
    findAll(@Query() paginationQuery: PaginationQueryDto) {
        // const { limit, offset } = paginationQuery;
        return this.coffeesService.findAll(paginationQuery);
    }
    ...
    ...
}
----
//}}}

With this setup, This `"ValidationPipe"` is *only* applied to this single `findALl()` - "Route - handler".

We are already familiar with the *3* different ways of tying *"filters"*, *"guards"*, *"pipes"*, and *"Interceptors"* to our "Route - handlers".
But as we said, there is a "4th" bonus way - that's only available to "Pipes", and it's called *"Param-based scope"*.

"Param-scoped Pipes", are useful when the "validation - logic" *concern* ONLY ONE "specific parameter".

Let's scroll down to the `update()` - method.

//{{{ coffees.controller.ts
[source, typescript]
----
// coffees.controller.ts
import { Controller, Get, Param, Body, Post, Patch, Delete, Query, Inject, UsePipes, ValidationPipe } from "@nestjs/common";

@Controller("coffees")
export class CoffeesController {
    constructor(
        private readonly coffeesService: CoffeesService,
        @Inject(REQUEST)
        private readonly request: Request,
    ) {
        console.log("[!!] CoffeesController created");
    }

    @UsePipes(new ValidationPipe())     // <<<
    @Get()
    findAll(@Query() paginationQuery: PaginationQueryDto) {
        // const { limit, offset } = paginationQuery;
        return this.coffeesService.findAll(paginationQuery);
    }
    ...
    ...
    @Patch(":id")
    update(@Param("id") id: string, @Body(ValidationPipe) updateCoffeeDto: UpdateCoffeeDto) {     // <<<
        return this.coffeesService.update(id, updateCoffeeDto);
    }
}
----
//}}}

This method takes "*2* - arguments": the "resource - *id*", as well as the
"payload" required to update the existing entity.

What if we want to bind a "Pipe" to the *"body"* of the request but not the
"*id* - parameter".  This is exactly where the "param - based" - Pipe comes in
handy.

By passing the `"ValidationPipe" - class reference, directly to the `"@Body"`
- decorator here, we can let Nest know to run *this particular - Pipe*
-exclusively for just this specific parameter!, and there we have it.

With these *4* powerful "building - blocks". We can now control the *"flow"*,
*"content"*, *"validation"* on anything in our application, globally, all the
way down to a specific *"controller"*, *"method"*, or even a *"parameter"*.

== Catch Exception With Filters
:fn-exception_filter: footnote:[https://github.com/nestjs/nest/blob/master/packages/common/exceptions/http.exception.ts]

//{{{ image::./images/chapter-6-11.png
[#img-chapter]
[link=./images/chapter-6-11.png]
.Catch Exception With Filters
image::./images/chapter-6-11.png[align="center"]
//}}}

NestJS comes with a built-in Exception "layer", responsible for processing all
"unhandled - Exceptions" across our application. When Expection is *NOT* handled
by our application, it is automatically caught by this "layer*, which send the
appropriate user-friendly response.

Out of the box. This action is performed by a built-in "global
- *ExceptionFilter*".  While this base built-in "ExceptionFilter" can
automatically handle many use cases for us.  We *may* want "full control" over
it.

//{{{ image::./images/chapter-6-12.png
[#img-chapter]
[link=./images/chapter-6-12.png]
.Catch Exception With Filters - 2
image::./images/chapter-6-12.png[align="center"]
//}}}

For example, we may want to add exception "logging" or "return" our Errors back
in a different "JSON - schema".  "Exception - Filters" are designed for exactly
this purpose!.

They let us be in charge of the exact *"flow of control"* and the "content" of
the Response being sent back to the client.

Let's create an "ExceptionFilter", that is responsible for "catching exception"
that are an instance of the "HttpException" - Class, and implement our own
*custom* "response - logic" for it.

Let's get started by firing up our terminal, and generating a *"filter"* - class
using the NEST - CLI "filter - schematic", by entering:

//{{{ $ nest g filter common/filters/http-exception
[source, shell]
----
$ nest g filter common/filters/http-exception
CREATE src/common/filters/http-exception.filter.spec.ts (201 bytes)
CREATE src/common/filters/http-exception.filter.ts (195 bytes)
----
//}}}

Note that we generated this *"filter"* in a `"/common/"` - directory, where we
can keep things that are *not* tied to any specific domain.

Let's open up he newly generated "HttpExceptionFilter", and see what we have
inside.

//{{{ http-exception-filter.ts
[source, typescript]
----
// http-exception-filter.ts
import { ArgumentsHost, Catch, ExceptionFilter, HttpException } from '@nestjs/common';

@Catch(HttpException) // <<<
export class HttpExceptionFilter<T> implements ExceptionFilter {
  catch(exception: T, host: ArgumentsHost) {}
}
----
//}}}

As you can see, the NEST - CLI generated and example  "filter", without any
"business logic" of course.

The `"@Catch()"` - decorator on top, *binds* the "required metadata" to the
"ExceptionFilter".  This `"@Catch()"` - decorator can take a "single
- parameter" or a "comma separated list".

This allows us to set up a "filter" for several "types of exceptions" at once if
we want it.

Since we want to process all exceptions that are instances of "HttpException".
Let's pass the "HttpException" - class between the parentheses `"()"`.

All "ExceptionFilter's" should implement the
`"ExceptionFilter{fn-exception_filter}"` - interface exported from
`@nestjs/common`.  This interface requires that we provide the `"catch()"`
- method with its indicated *"method signature"*.  Also we can see that our
class accepts a "Type - Argument", which indicates the Type of the *"exception
argument"* in our `"catch()"` - method.

Again, since we want to process all exceptions that are instances of
a `"HttpException"`. Let's changes this to `*"<T extends HttpException>"*`.

//{{{ http-exception-filter.ts
[source, typescript]
----
// http-exception-filter.ts
import { ArgumentsHost, Catch, ExceptionFilter, HttpException } from "@nestjs/common";
import { Response } from "express";

@Catch(HttpException)
export class HttpExceptionFilter<T extends HttpException> implements ExceptionFilter {  // <<<
    catch(exception: T, host: ArgumentsHost) {
        const ctx = host.switchToHttp();
        const response = ctx.getResponse<Response>();

        const status = exception.getStatus();
        const exceptionResponse = exception.getResponse();

        const error = typeof response === "string" ? { message: exceptionResponse } : (exceptionResponse as object);

        response.status(status).json({
            ...error
        })
    }
}
----
//}}}

All right, with all of that setup now, we can implement our *custom* - "response
- logic".  To do this, we'll need to access the "underlying - platform"
- `"Response{}"` Object so that we can *manipulate or transform* it and CONTINUE
sending the response - afterwards.

So where we get a *hold* of the "original Response"?

Let's use the second parameter here, `"host:"` which we can see as an instance
of `"ArgumentsHost"`, and call the method `"switchToHttp()"` on it. Saving this
as the variable `"ctx"`, short for "context".  This `"switchToHttp()"` - method
gives us access to the *native in-flight* "Request or Response Objects".  Which
is exactly what we need here.

Next, let use this `"ctx"` - variable, and call the `"getResponse()"` - method
on it.  This method will return our "underlying platforms" - Response.

NOTE: Remember in NestJS, this is ExpressJS by default, but could also be
swapped for Fastify.

For better "Type - safety" here. Let's specify the "Type" as a `"<Response>"`,
importing this Type from the `"express"` - packages.

Now we have our "Response". Let's use the "exception - parameter" available to
us in *this* - method, and extract "*2* - things".  The `*"statusCode"*`, and
`*"body"*` from the "current - exception".

To get the *"status"*, we can simply call the `"getStatus()"` - method as we see
above.

Let's also get a *hold* of a "raw - `"exceptionResponse"` ", by calling to
`"getResponse()"` - method and saving that variable as well.

Since for demonstration purposes - we're trying to pass back this *original
- "Error - Response", we need to do a little bit of work here.

First we need to test whether the Response is a String or an Object. If it's
a string, we're going to create an Object an put that String inside of the
"message - property". Otherwise we're all set in our "exceptionResponse" is
already an Object.

By doing of this. Our Errors will now be fairly "uniform", and we can (`"..."`)
*spread* this "error - variable" into our "final - response", which we'll do in
a moment!.

Great, so now that we have everything we need. Let's start building our
"response" *back* that we'll be sending.

First, let's set the "StatusCode" for the response we're going to send back via
the `"status()"` - method (`*"response.status(status)"*`).

Lastly, we need to send the `"exceptionResponse"` back. Our application
underlying platform is ExpressJS, which is the default. So there are several
ways we could do this!.

In our case. Let's just use Express's `".json()"` - method. We ca  simply chain
this method after our `"status()"` - call (as we see above), and using the
(`"..."`) "spread - operator", we can pass the original Error from our Exception
inside this `".json()"` - method.

As of right now. Our `"ExceptionFilter"` here isn't really doing anything unique
yet. So let's pass in something custom here along with the "original
- exception". This way we have something we can look for in all of our "errors"
to make sure everything with the `"ExceptionFilter"` works!.

Let's add a new `"timestamp"` - property and give it the value of `*"new
Date().toISOString()"*`.

Great. Now with all this in place, let's *bind* this "global
- `"ExceptionFilter"` " to our application.

Since we *don't need* any "external - providers" here, we can just *bind* this
"ExceptionFilter - globally" using the " `"app"` - instance" in our `"main.ts"`
- file.

Let's head over to the `"main.ts"` - file and add it real quick with
`"app.useGlobalFilters()"`.

//{{{ main.ts
[source, typescript]
----
// main.ts
import { NestFactory } from "@nestjs/core";
import { HttpException, ValidationPipe } from "@nestjs/common";

import { AppModule } from "./app.module";
import { HttpExceptionFilter } from  "./common/filters/http-exception.filter";

async function bootstrap() {
    const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);

    app.useGlobalPipes(
        new ValidationPipe({
            whitelist: true,
            transform: true,
            forbidNonWhitelisted: true,
            transformOptions: {
                enableImplicitConversion: true,
            },
        }),
    );
    app.useGlobalFilters(new HttpExceptionFilter()); // <<<
    await app.listen(3002);

    // console.log("app is run on port: 3002");
}
bootstrap();
----
//}}}

Now that everything's in place. Let's test it out by triggering some "AP
errors!".  Let's make sure that our app is running in our terminal, and if not,
make sure we run: `"npm run start:dev"`.

With our applications running. Let's open up `insomnia`, and perform a GET
- request to a "non existing* - resource and purposely make an Error happen!.

Let's hit someting `/coffees/-1` where "-1" is obviously an `"id"` we don't have
in the database.

//{{{ request: 'GET - http://localhost:3002/coffees/-1'
[source, json]
----
// request: 'GET - http://localhost:3002/coffees/-1'

// Body - raw: JSON
{}

// response, 404 -  NOT FOUND
{
    "statusCode": 404,
    "message": "Coffee with 'id: #-1' not found",
    "error": "Not Found",
    "timestamp": "2021-04-06T07:30:31.156Z"
}
----
//}}}

As we can see, the Response came back with an Error and clearly used new custom
"ExceptionFilter". Since the response contains our new `"timestamp"` - property.
Perfect!.

So naturally this exception we created was a basic example implementation. But
you can see that within this "ExceptionFilter", we could have just as easily
used some sort of "logging - Service" to track our errors, maybe even called an
"Analytics - API".  Anything we'd want to do whenever an "HttpException" occurs
in our application.

Guards have a single responsibility. Which is to determine whether a "given
request" is allowed access to something.

If the "request" meets certain conditions, such as *"permissions"*. *"roles"*,
*"ACLs.footnote:acl[]"*, etc..  It *will* be allowed access to that route.

If the condition are *NOT* met, that it will be *denied* and an Error will be
thrown.

One of the best use-cases for "Guard": is *"Authentication"* and
*"Authorization"*.

//{{{ image::./images/chapter-6-14.png
[#img-chapter]
[link=./images/chapter-6-14.png]
.Protect Routes With Guards - 2
image::./images/chapter-6-14.png[align="center"]
//}}}

For example, we could implement a "Guard" that "extract" and "validates
a Token", and uses the extracted information to determine whether the "request
can *proceed* or *not*".

Since there are many different approaches and strategies to handle
authentication and authorization. In this lessons we'll focus on a simplified
example and learn how to leverage Guards themselves in our projects.

NOTE: If you're interested in learning more about Authentication itself, check
out our separate Course extension, which particularly focused on implementation
of an Enterprise-grade Authentication feature, and all the complexities that go
along with that.

All right. So to learn how to Guard - "*work conceptually*", let's create
a Guard that is responsible for *"2"* things:

1. Validating whether an API_KEY is present within an "authorization" - Header.
2. Validating whether the route being accessed is specified as *"public"*.

Let's call this new - Guard `*"ApiKeyGuard"*`. Let's fire up the terminal and
generate a "Guard - class" using the Nest - CLI.

//{{{ $ nest g guard common/guard/api-key
[source, shell]
----
$ nest g guard common/guard/api-key
CREATE src/common/guard/api-key.guard.spec.ts (169 bytes)
CREATE src/common/guard/api-key.guard.ts (301 bytes)
----
//}}}

NOTE: We generate this Guard in the `"/common/"` - *directory*, where we can
keep things that aren't tied to any specific domain.

All right, let's open up this newly generated "ApiKeyGuard" - file, and see what
we have inside.

//{{{ api-key.guard.ts
[source, typescript]
----
// api-key.guard.ts
import { CanActivate, ExecutionContext, Injectable } from "@nestjs/common";
import { Observable } from "rxjs";

@Injectable()
export class ApiKeyGuard implements CanActivate {
    canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): boolean | Promise<boolean> | Observable<boolean> {
        return true;
    }
}
----
//}}}

As we can see the Nest - CLI generated an example Guard for us, *without any
logic* inside of course.  Similar to Providers. A Guard is just a Class with the
`"@Injectable()"` - decorator which we've seen in previous lessons.

One important requirement of Guard is, that they should *implement* the
`"canActivate"` - interface exported from `@nestjs/common`.  This interface
requires us to provide the `"canActivate()"` - method within our class.

This `"canActivate()"` - method should return *Boolean*, indicating whether the
"current - request" is allowed to proceed OR denied access.  This method *can
also* "return a Response" that's either synchronous or asynchronous, such as
a `"Promise"` or `"Observable"`.

Nest will use the "return - value" to control the next action. If it return
- `*"true"*`: the request will be processed. If it return `*"false"*`: Nest will
deny the request.

Looking at the example code, the Nest - CLI generated for us here. We have
`*"return true"*` hard-coded for now.  This means that currently, every request
will be allowed to proceed!.

Just for testing purposes, let's changes a couple line,

//{{{ api-key.guard.ts
[source, typescript]
----
// api-key.guard.ts
import { CanActivate, ExecutionContext, Injectable } from "@nestjs/common";
import { Observable } from "rxjs";

@Injectable()
export class ApiKeyGuard implements CanActivate {
    canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): boolean | Promise<boolean> | Observable<boolean> {
        return false;   // <<<
    }
}
----
//}}}

We change `*"return true"*` to `*"return false"*`, indicating that every request
should be "*denied* - access".

Now that our initial "Mock Guard" is all set.  Let's bind it to our application
"globally".

Let's open up the "main.ts" - file, and add `*"AppUseGlobalGuards()"*`, passing
in our new "ApiKeyGuard" inside of it.

//{{{ main.ts
[source, typescript]
----
// main.ts
import { NestFactory } from "@nestjs/core";
import { HttpException, ValidationPipe } from "@nestjs/common";

import { AppModule } from "./app.module";
import { ApiKeyGuard } from  "./common/guard/api-key.guard";    // <<<

async function bootstrap() {
    const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);

    app.useGlobalPipes(
        new ValidationPipe({
            whitelist: true,
            transform: true,
            forbidNonWhitelisted: true,
            transformOptions: {
                enableImplicitConversion: true,
            },
        }),
    );
    app.useGlobalGuard( new ApiKeyGuard());     // <<<
    await app.listen(3002);

    // console.log("app is run on port: 3002");
}
bootstrap();
----
//}}}

Let's make sure that our applications is running in the background, and let's
navigate to `insomnia` and test any endpoint.

//{{{ request: 'GET - http://localhost:3002/coffees/'
[source, json]
----
// request: 'GET - http://localhost:3002/coffees/'

// Body - raw: JSON
{}

// response, 403 -  FORBIDDEN
{
    "statusCode": 403,
    "message": "Forbidden resource",
    "error": "Forbidden"
}
----
//}}}

As we can see ALL of our endpoints now responds with status `"403 Forbidden
Resource"`, just as we expected. It works perfectly.

But right now our Guard is not programmatically determining anything about our
"Route" or the "Caller" yet. It's simply always returning `"false"`.

That doesn't make much sense right? Instead let's set up our Guard to handle the
scenario we talked about in the beginning of this lesson. Which is to "validate
an API_KEY that should be present within each request", but-only-on routes that
are *NOT* specified as *"public"*.

So how can we get started here?.

Well, first let's define this "API_KEY" that we're talking about. To make sure
that we *never* push this *secret key* to our *Git - Repo*.  Let's define the
"API_KEY" as an "environment - variable".

Open up our `".env"` - file that we created in a previous lesson and let's add
the following `"API_KEY"` - line.

//{{{ .env
[source, typescript]
----
// .env
/*
* CAUTION:  never SUBMIT or PUSH this crendential '.env' - file in github or track on Git!.
* This only for course and education purpose.
*/

...
...
API_KEY=7AddwM8892Pbsewqaxx00wqaMMzal
----
//}}}

NOTE: The "API_KEY" here is just a random generated String, so feel free to use
whatever you'd like for this example.

Within this in place. Let's head back to our Guard.

Here in our Guard. We want to retrieve the API_KEY from any "incoming - request"
that is not labeled as "public". We'll be handling this "public - part" in
a moment.

//{{{ api-key.guard.ts
[source, typescript]
----
// api-key.guard.ts
import { CanActivate, ExecutionContext, Injectable } from "@nestjs/common";
import { Observable } from "rxjs";

@Injectable()
export class ApiKeyGuard implements CanActivate {
    canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): boolean | Promise<boolean> | Observable<boolean> {
        const request = context.switchToHttp().getResponse<Request>()
        const authHeader = request.header("Authorization")

        return authHeader === proceess.env.API_KEY;
    }
}
----
//}}}

For our "API_KEY". Let's assume that the "caller" is passing this "key" as an
*"authorization - header"*.  To get the information about this "HTTP - request".
We'll need to access it all from the "ExecutionContext" ("contex' - param),
which inherits from `*"ArgumentsHost"*`, which we've already familiarized
yourself with when we used it with the "ExceptionFilter".

We can actually use those same "helper - methods" from before, but this time, to
get the reference of the "Request - Object" instead of the Response.

This `"switchToHttp"` - method, guves us access to the native "in-flight
Request", "Response", and "Next" Objects!  Which is exactly what we need.

Next we need to call the `"getRequest()"` - method on it, which will return our
underlying platform's "Request wrapper object".

Remember in Nest this is ExpressJS by default. But you could also be swapped for
Fastify.

For better "Type - safety" here. Let's specify type as a `<Request>` importing
this Type from the `express` - package again.

Now let's use this "Request - object" to retrieve the "*authorization* - header"
from each request, if it's even there.

Lastly, let's compare the "authorization header" passed in, with the "registered
API_KEY" we have stored in our "environment - variable".

For now we'll simply access the "environment - variables" using the
`"process.env"` - Object but *ideally* you'd want to leverage the
(`@nestjs/config`) `"ConfigService"` instead.

With all of this in place. Let's open `insomnia` and test *any* endpoint in our
application, and see if our Guard works so far.

//{{{ request: 'GET - http://localhost:3002/coffees/'
[source, json]
----
// request: 'GET - http://localhost:3002/coffees/'

// Body - raw: JSON
{}

// response, 403 -  FORBIDDEN
{
    "statusCode": 403,
    "message": "Forbidden resource",
    "error": "Forbidden"
}
----
//}}}

As we can see our application responded with the status `"403 Forbidden
Resource"`.

Since we didn't pass in any authorization header especially one with our
specific "API_KEY". It looks like our Guard is working perfectly.

Let's try the same API - request again but this time let's add an
"*authorization* - header" with the "correct - API_KEY".

With these in place. Let's hit send and call the endpoint again.

//{{{ request: 'GET - http://localhost:3002/coffees/'
[source, json]
----
// request: 'GET - http://localhost:3002/coffees/'

// Body - raw: JSON
{}

    "Authorization": "7AddwM8892Pbsewqaxx00wqaMMzal"
}

// response, 200 -  OK
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "Salemba Roast#1",
        "description": null,
        "brand": "Salemba Brew",
        "recomendations": 0,
        "flavors": [
            {
                "id": 1,
                "name": "chocolate"
            },
            {
                "id": 2,
                "name": "vanilla"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "title": "Salemba Roast#2",
        "description": null,
        "brand": "Salemba Brew",
        "recomendations": 0,
        "flavors": []
    },
    {
        "id": 3,
        "title": "Salemba Roast#3",
        "description": null,
        "brand": "Salemba Brew",
        "recomendations": 0,
        "flavors": []
    }
]
----
//}}}

Perfect. We've got a `"200"` response back and no error this time!.

Our Guard was able to verify that the "Authorization - header" matched our
"secret - API_KEY" and we were allowed access to continue the "API - Request".

So far we've finished setting up the "API_KEY - validation" - functionality we
wanted, *but* still aren't checking whether the "specific - route" being
accessed is *"public"* or *not*.

In the next chapter we'll look at how Metadata and a few Nest features can help
us achieve just that!.

//}}}

In the last lesson, we implement the first goal for our "new Guard". Which was
to verify an "API - Token" is present when a "Route is accessed".

In this lesson, we'll be looking at how we can complete the next piece of
functionality we needed, which was to detect whether the route being access is
declared *"public"* or *not*.

//{{{ image::./images/chapter-6-14.png

.Using Metadata To Build Generic Guard and Interceptor -2
image::./images/chapter-6-14.png[align="center"]
//}}}

How can we declaratively specific which endpoints in our application are
"public", or any "data" we want stored alongside controllers or routes.

This is exactly where "custom - Metadata" comes into play.

//{{{ image::./images/chapter-6-16.png
[#img-chapter]
[link=./images/chapter-6-16.png]
.Using Metadata To Build Generic Guard and Interceptor -3
image::./images/chapter-6-16.png[align="center"]
//}}}

Nest provides the ability to attach "custom - Metadata" to "routes - handlers"
through the `"@SetMetadata()"` - decorator.  The `"@SetMetadata()"` - decorator
takes "*two* - parameters".

- First being the *"key"* that will be used as the "lookup key",
- Second, is "metadata - *value*" which can be any Type.
  This is where we put whatever values we want to *store* for this "*specific - key*".

So let's put this to  use, to learn how it all works.

Let's open our "CoffeesController" - file. Head over to our "findAll()"
- method, and add this `@SetMetadata()` - decorator on top. Making sure it's
*imported* from the `nestjs/common` package.

//{{{ coffees.controller.ts
[source, typescript]
----
// coffees.controller.ts
import {
    Controller,
    Get,
    Param,
    Body,
    Post,
    Patch,
    Delete,
    Query,
    Inject,
    UsePipes,
    ValidationPipe,
    SetMetadata                     // <<<
} from "@nestjs/common";
...
...

@Controller("coffees")
export class CoffeesController {
    constructor(
        ...
        ...
    ) {
        console.log("[!!] CoffeesController created");
    }

    @SetMetadata("isPublic", true)  // <<<
    @Get()
    findAll(@Query() paginationQuery: PaginationQueryDto) {
        // const { limit, offset } = paginationQuery;
        return this.coffeesService.findAll(paginationQuery);
    }
    ...
    ...
}
----
//}}}

Inside the decorator. Let's pass those "Metadata - Key" and "values
- *parameters*".

For our *"key"*, let's enter the String of `*"isPublic"*`, for our *"value"*
let's enter a Boolean of `*"true"*`.

This is the most bare-bones way of setting up Metadata on a route, but it's
*NOT* actually the "best practice".

Ideally we should create our own decorator to achieve the same result. This is
much better practice, because we will have less duplicated code, we can reuse
the decorator in multiple places, and a "custom - decorator" gives us much more
"Type - safety".

Let's improve our existing code and make our "*own - decorator*", and call it
`*"Public"*`.

First, let's create a new folder within the `"/common/"` - directory and call it
`"/decorators/"`. Here we can store any other future decorator we might make.
In this folder. Let's create a new file called `*"public.decorator.ts"*`.

Let's open up our new file,

//{{{ public.decorator.ts
[source, typescript]
----
// public.decorator.ts
import { SetMetadata } from "@nestjs/common";

export const IS_PUBLIC_KEY ="isPublic";

export const Public = () => SetMetadata(IS_PUBLIC_KEY, true);
----
//}}}

In this file. We're going to export *2* things.

- First, our metadata "key",
- Second, our new decorator itself, that we're going to call "Public".

For our "key" let's exports `"const = IS_PUBLIC_KEY"` and set it equal to the
string of "isPublic".  Just like we called previously.

The benefit of exporting this variable here is, that anywhere we might look up
this metadata, we can now import this variable, instead of using "magic
- string" and accidentally mistyping the name.

Now let's export our "decorator" by typing `"export const Public"`, and setting
this equal to an arrow function (`"=>"`) that return `"SetMetadata"`.

Inside of `"SetMetadata()"`, just like before, we need to pass in "key" and
"value".  So let's use our "IS_PUBLIC_KEY" - variable and for the value let's
pass in the Boolean of `"true"`, just like we did previously.

That's it!. We just made our *first* - decorator!.

Next let's swap out the code we previously added in our "CoffeesController" to
use our "new - decorator".  Let's head back over to that `findAll()` - method
signature and replace the previously added `@SetMetadata` - expression with this
`@Public()` - decorator, making sure import it from our local directory.

//{{{ coffees.controller.ts
[source, typescript]
----
// coffees.controller.ts
...
...

import { Public } from "../common/decorators/public.decorator";

@Controller("coffees")
export class CoffeesController {
    constructor(
        ...
        ...
    ) {
        console.log("[!!] CoffeesController created");
    }

    @Public()
    @Get()
    findAll(@Query() paginationQuery: PaginationQueryDto) {
        // const { limit, offset } = paginationQuery;
        return this.coffeesService.findAll(paginationQuery);
    }
    ...
    ...
}
----
//}}}

Perfect. We now have much more "future - proof" and easily reusable decorator
that we can use throughout entire application if needed!.

Let's tie everything together and fix up that "ApiKeyGuard" to use it.

Currently, our Guard return "true" or "false", depending on whether the
"API_KEY" was provided with the request.  But now we need to add our
`"isPublic"` - logic here.

We need the Guard to return `"true"`, when the `"isPublic"` - metadata is found,
*before* continuing further and testing whether an `"API_KEY"` is present.

In order to access the "Routes - Metadata" in our Guard. We'll need to use a new
"*helper - class*" called `*"Reflector"*`.

The `*"Reflector"*` - class allows us to *retrieve* metadata within a *specific
context*. This class is provided out of the box by the Nest - framework, from
the `@nestjs/core` - package.

Let's inject the `*"Reflector"*` - class here, inside of our
`*"constructor()"*`.

//{{{ api-key.guard.ts
[source, typescript]
----
// api-key.guard.ts
import { CanActivate, ExecutionContext, Injectable } from "@nestjs/common";
import { Reflector } from "@nestjs/core";           // <<<
import { ConfigService } from "@nestjs/config";     // <<<
import { Observable } from "rxjs";
import { Request } from "express";

import { IS_PUBLIC_KEY } from "../decorators/public.decorator";

@Injectable()
export class ApiKeyGuard implements CanActivate {
    constructor(
        private readonly reflector: Reflector,          // <<<
        private readonly configService: ConfigService,  // <<<
    ) {}

    canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): boolean | Promise<boolean> | Observable<boolean> {
        const isPublic = this.reflector.get(IS_PUBLIC_KEY, context.getHandler())    // <<<

        if (isPublic) {
            return true
        }

        const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest<Request>();
        const authHeader = request.header("Authorization");

        return authHeader === this.configService.get("API_KEY");
    }
}
----
//}}}

Now we can use this Provider within the `"CanActivate()"` - method, to retrieve
the metadata of our handler.

Let's add a new variable called `*"isPublic"*`. With this variable, let's
utilize `"this.reflector.get()"` which looks up metadata by its *"key"*. In our
case the exported variable `"IS_PUBLIC_KEY"`, we just made a moment a go.

`"Reflector"` is requires a *"target object context"*, for the "second
- parameter", in our case we want to target the *"method - handler"* in our
  "given - context". So let's pass in `"context.getHandler()"`.

NOTE: Just for reference. If you need to retrieve metadata from a *"Class
- level"*, you'd call `*"context.getClass()"*` here instead.

NOTE: For more information on `"Reflector"` and other possibilities here. Read
more about it in NestJS documentation

Okay. Great. Now that we have the "value" from our decorator inside of our
Guard, there's one last thing we need to do.

If a route is *"public"*. We can simply skip the validation of the `"API_KEY"`.

Let's add a simple `if` - statement. If `"isPublic"` is `"true"`, let's just
`"return true"`.

Lastly, we mentioned earlier that we shouldn't use `"process.env"` directly.  So
let's fix that and instead use the "ConfigService".

Let's move into the `"constructor()"` real quick and inject "ConfigService".

With this "Service - injected", we can now replace the previously used
`"process.env.API_KEY"` call, with: `this.configService.get()` pasing in the
string of `"API_KEY"`.

Let's save our changes and check the terminal to make sure everything compiling
correctly.

//{{{ $ npm run start:dev
[source, shell]

----
//}}}

OK, so our Guard is ready, but it looks like the application *couldn't*
bootstrap properly, and it is throwing compilation errors!. What happened? Well,
this errors appears because we're using "Dependency Injection" *inside of our
Guard*, which was instantiated in the "main.ts" - file.

So how can we fix this?

As we showed in previous lesson. "Global Guards" that *depend* on other
"Classes" *MUST* be registered within a " `"@Module"` - context".

Let's fix this real quick, and add this Guard to a Module; and actually let's
take it up a notch, and create a "new - Module" for our "common" - folder, and
we can instantiated our Guard there.

Let's fire up another terminal window, and let's generate a Module and call it
`*"common"*` with

//{{{ $ nest g mo common
[source, shell]
----
$ nest g module common
CREATE src/common/common.module.ts (83 bytes)
UPDATE src/app.module.ts (1775 bytes)
----
//}}}

This will generate a "Module - class" where we can register any "global
- enhancers" we might make in the future including our "ApiKeyGuard".

Great. So let's open up our "new - Module" and utilize the "custom - provide"
setup we learned in a previous lessons.

//{{{ common.module.ts
[source, typescript]
----
// common.module.ts
import { Module } from "@nestjs/common";
import { ConfigModule } from "@nestjs/config";
import { APP_GUARD } from "@nestjs/core";
import { ApiKeyGuard } from "../common/guard/api-key.guard";

@Module({
    imports: [ConfigModule],
    providers: [
        {
            provide: APP_GUARD,
            useClass: ApiKeyGuard,
        },
    ],
})
export class CommonModule {}
----
//}}}

This is where we pass in an "object" into our " `provider` - Array" providing
a specific "Class" or "Key" and then "Value" to be used for it.

Inside of our `@Module()` - decorator. Let's add a `providers: []` Array, and
pass in an Object with `"provide: APP_GUARD"` and `"useClass: ApiKeyGuard"`.

This setup is very similar to using `"app.useGlobalGuards()"` that we had in our
`"main.ts"` - file.  But as we said, that option is only available if our Guard
*DO NOT* use "Dependency - Injection".

NOTE: There is a way around that, but it isn't best practice since you'd have to
manually pass in dependencies.

One last thing here. Let's make sure to import `"ConfigModule"` in the `"import:
[]"` Array here, so we can use "ConfigService" in our Guard.

Now let's open up our `"main.ts"` - file and remove that `"useGlobalGuards"`
line, since we don't need it anymore and save all of our changes.

//{{{ api-key.guard.ts

    );
    await app.listen(3002);

    // console.log("app is run on port: 3002");
}
bootstrap();

Let's switch to our terminal window again to make sure everything can bootstrap
properly now.

Great. Everything's is compiling again.

Now, let's open up `insomnia` and put our new Guard to the test. Let's start by
removing the "Authorization - header", and make a GET `/coffees` - request,
which we setup to use our `@Public()` - decorator. If everything works as
expected it should *not" return a `*"403 Error"*`. Since our Guard *should allow
access* to it.

//{{{ request: 'GET - http://localhost:3002/coffees/'

                "name": "chocolate"
            },
            {
                "id": 2,
                "name": "vanilla"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "title": "Salemba Roast#2",
        "description": null,
        "brand": "Salemba Brew",
        "recomendations": 0,

        "recomendations": 0,
        "flavors": []
    }
]
----
//}}}

It worked, great!.

Next, let's try a Route that *doesn't* have the `@Public()` - decorator, like
a GET - request to the endpoint `/coffees/1`.  Our Guard should *deny* us access
to this Route, since it is neither "public" nor are we passing in an
"Authorization - header".

//{{{ request: 'GET - http://localhost:3002/coffees/1'

// response, 403 -  FORBIDDEN
{
    "statusCode": 403,
    "message": "Forbidden resource",
    "error": "Forbidden"
}
----
//}}}

There it is. `"403 - Forbidden"`. Our Guard works perfectly!.

So to wrap up, we covered a lot of ground (sublime) in this lesson. Tapping into
a lot of *concepts* we learned in previous lessons.

Now we have additional power to create our "own - decorators", and utilize
"handler - Metadata", useful for anything our application might need in the
future.

*Interceptor* have many useful capabilities inspired by the "Aspect Oriented
Programming.footnote:aop[] - technique". This technique *aims* to increase
"modularity" by allowing the separation of "cross-cut" and "concerns".

Interceptor achieve this by adding "*additional - behavior*" to existing code,
without modifying the code itself!.

//{{{ image::./images/chapter-6-18.png

//}}}

Interceptor make it possible for us to:

1. Bind *extra logic*, "*before*" or "*after* - method" execution.
2. Transform the *"result"* returned from a method.
3. Transform the "*Exception* - thrown" from a method
4. Extend basic "method - behavior"
4. Completely "*overriding* a method" - depending on specific conditions. For
example: doing something like *caching* - "various - responses".

All right. So to learn how Interceptor "work - *conceptually*". Let's learn
through an example use-case where we *always* want our responses, to be located
within a " `*"data"*` - property" (`"data: response_here"`); and create a "new
- Interceptor" to handle this for us.

Let's call this "new - Interceptor" `*"WrapResponseInterceptor"*`. This new
Interceptor will handle *ALL* - "incoming - requests", and *"WRAP"* our data for
us automatically.

To get started. Let's generate an "Interceptor - class" using the Nest -CLI by
entering:

//{{{ $ nest g interceptor common/interceptor/wrap-response
[source, shell]
----
$ nest g interceptor common/interceptor/wrap-response
CREATE src/common/interceptor/wrap-response.interceptor.spec.ts (217 bytes)
CREATE src/common/interceptor/wrap-response.interceptor.ts (318 bytes)
----
//}}}

NOTE: We generated this Interceptor in the `*"/common/"*` - directory like we
have many times before, since Interceptor *isn't* specific to any specific
domain.

Let's open up this newly  generated `"WrapResponseInterceptor"` - file and see
what we have inside.

//{{{ wrap-response.interceptor.ts
[source, typescript]
----
// wrap-response.interceptor.ts
import { CallHandler, ExecutionContext, Injectable, NestInterceptor } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable()
export class WrapResponseInterceptor implements NestInterceptor {
  intercept(context: ExecutionContext, next: CallHandler): Observable<any> {
    return next.handle();
  }
}
----
//}}}

The Nest - CLI generated an example Interceptor for us without any "business
- logic".

Similar to Providers, an Interceptor is a Class with the `"@Injectable()"`
- decorator.  All Interceptor should implement the `NestInterceptor` - interface
exported from `@nestjs/common` - package.

This interface requires that we provide the `intercept()` - method within our
class. The `intercept()` - method should return an "*Observable"* from the "RxJS
- library".

If you are not familiar with RxJS. It is a *library* for *"Reactive Programming
using Observables"*.  Making it easier to "compose - asynchronous" or "callback"
- "base code".

RxJS itself is outside of the scope of what we can dive into here. Just know
that it's powerful alternative to "*Promises* or *callbacks*".

Back to our code. The `"CallHandler"` - interface here implement the
`"handler()"` - method (`"next.handle()"`), which you can use to invoke the
"Route - handler" - method within your Interceptor.

If you don't call the `"handle()"` - method in your implementation of the
`intercept()` - method.  The "Route - handler" - method *WONT* be *executed at
all*.

This approach means that the `intercept()` - method effectively "*wrap*" the
`Request/Response` - stream, allowing us to implement "custom - logic" both
*"before"* and *"after"* the *execution* of the *final* - "Route - handler".

All right. So we've covered a lot of theory so far.

Let's add some `"console.log()'s"`, to see where Interceptors fit in the
"Request/Response" - life-cycle.

//{{{ wrap-response.interceptor.ts
[source, typescript]
----
// wrap-response.interceptor.ts
import { CallHandler, ExecutionContext, Injectable, NestInterceptor } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { tap } from "rxjs/operators";

@Injectable()
export class WrapResponseInterceptor implements NestInterceptor {
  intercept(context: ExecutionContext, next: CallHandler): Observable<any> {

      console.log("Before..");

    return next.handle().pipe(tap(data => console.log("After..", data)));
  }
}
----
//}}}

Since we've called the `console.log()` *"before"* calling the `"next.handle()"` - method.

Our `"Before.."` - message should appear in the console BEFORE the actual
"Route - handler" is executed by the framework.

Since "handle" return an RxJS - Observable. We have a wide choice of operators we
can use to manipulate the "stream" here.

In this example. We're using the `"tap()"` - operator which invokes an anonymous logging function upon graceful termination
of the "Observable - stream". But (the `tap()` - operator) doesn't otherwise interfere with the response - cycle at all.

The `"data"` - argument of the arrow function (`"=>"`) and we passed into the `tap()` - operator here, is in fact *the response*
sent back from the "Route - handler"!.

Basically think of this as whatever comes back from our endpoint!.

Here. We're just doing a `console.log()` to say `"After..."`, and logging that `"data"` back as well.

To test it all out. Let's *bind* this Interceptor to our application globally.

Let's open our `"main.ts"` - file and add, `"app.useGlobalInterceptors()"`,
passing in `"new WrapResponseInterceptor()"`.

//{{{ main.ts
[source, typescript]
----
// main.ts
import { NestFactory } from "@nestjs/core";
import { HttpException, ValidationPipe } from "@nestjs/common";

import { AppModule } from "./app.module";
import { ApiKeyGuard } from "./common/guard/api-key.guard";
import { WrapResponseInterceptor } from "./common/interceptor/wrap-response.Interceptor";

async function bootstrap() {
    const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);

    app.useGlobalPipes(
        new ValidationPipe({
            whitelist: true,
            transform: true,
            forbidNonWhitelisted: true,
            transformOptions: {
                enableImplicitConversion: true,
            },
        }),
    );
    app.useGlobalInterceptors(new WrapResponseInterceptor());
    await app.listen(3002);

    // console.log("app is run on port: 3002");
}
bootstrap();
----
//}}}

Let's make sure our application is running in the background and let's navigate to `insomnia` and
test any endpoint in our application.

First let's make sure we have some "Coffees" stored in our database. If you have "Coffees" on your
database you can skip this action.

To do so. Let's hit the POST `/coffees/` - endpoint and add a random "Coffee".

//{{{ request: 'POST - http://localhost:3002/coffees/'

            {

                "name": "vanilla"
            }
        ]
    },
    {

        "recomendations": 0,
        "flavors": []
    }
]
----
//}}}

Perfect. Now let's hit the GET `/coffees/` - endpoint and switch back to terminal to see those `console.log()'s`.

//{{{ $ npm run start:dev

  }
]
----
//}}}

As we can see, `"Before..."` was logged; and *then* `"After.."`, followed by the actual `"value"` from our
`"findAll()"` - method, which represents the `/coffees/` - endpoints. It looks like our Interceptor worked!.

Let's open up `insomnia` again, and test another endpoint. Let's test GET `/coffees/1` - endpoint this time.

//{{{ request: 'POST - http://localhost:3002/coffees/'

            "id": 2,
            "name": "vanilla"
        }
    ]
}
----
//}}}

Let's going back into terminal. This time we should see a "single - Object" following the `"After..."` - log in our terminal.

//{{{ $ npm run start:dev

    Flavor { id: 2, name: 'vanilla' }
  ]
}
----
//}}}

Great, so far so good.

So now that we could see how Interceptors work and their part in the "Request/Response" - life-cycle.

Let's implement our *"data - wrapper"* idea we talked about at the beginning of this lesson, and "*wrap*" our Response's
inside of a " `*data*` - property".

To do this, let's replace the `"tap()"` - function with the `"map()"` - operator.

//{{{ wrap-response.interceptor.ts
[source, typescript]
----
// wrap-response.interceptor.ts
import { CallHandler, ExecutionContext, Injectable, NestInterceptor } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { tap, map } from "rxjs/operators";

@Injectable()
export class WrapResponseInterceptor implements NestInterceptor {
    intercept(context: ExecutionContext, next: CallHandler): Observable<any> {

        console.log("Before..");

        // return next.handle().pipe(tap(data => console.log("After...", data)))
        return next.handle().pipe(map((data) => ({data})));
    }
}
----
//}}}

The `map()` - operator takes a "*value*" from the "*stream*" and returns
a modified one.  Since we wanted to wrap all "*Responses*" in the `*"data"*`
- property.  Let's return an Object `"{}"` with a "key/value" of `*"data"*`.

Every time this `map()` - function s called, it return a "new - Object" with
a `"data"` - property filled with our *"original - Response"*.

NOTE: Remember!, everything we've done here is mainly for demonstration
purposes.

Hopefully now you can see the *power of Interceptors*, and how there's
a potential to do so many other things here, like: "passing down *version
number*", "analytics - tracking", etc..

All right. So let's save all of our changes open up `insomnia` and test out this
Interceptor.  Let's execute any "HTTP - Request" and see what the application
send back to us.

//{{{ request: 'POST - http://localhost:3002/coffees/'
[source, json]
----
// request: 'POST - http://localhost:3002/coffees/'

// Body - raw: JSON
{}

// Header
{}

// response, 200 -  OK
{
    "data": {   // <<<
        "id": 1,
        "title": "Salemba Roast#1",
        "description": null,
        "brand": "Salemba Brew",
        "recomendations": 0,
        "flavors": [
            {
                "id": 1,
                "name": "chocolate"
            },
            {
                "id": 2,
                "name": "vanilla"
            }
        ]
    }
----
//}}}

Perfect as we can see, the Response was automatically wrapped in an Object
within the `"data"` - property.

So, wrapping up in this lesson we've show how Interceptor give us an incredible
power to manipulate "Requests" OR "Responses", without changing *ANY* underlying
code.
