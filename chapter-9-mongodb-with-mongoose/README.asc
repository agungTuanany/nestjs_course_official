NOTE: This section is a continuation of Chapter-Two.

Before we get started, all of the code used in this entire Mongo - section of
this course is based on the code we've created in {fn-link_chapter2}["Chapter-2:
Creating a Rest API application"].

We are doing this so we can see and easily compare how an application can
leverage either NoSQL or SQL in implementing similar features with NestJS.

By fracturing these NoSQL and SQL sections, you can easily choose and watch
whichever section you need for your project.

If you save your code form Chapter-2. Make sure to switch back to that branch,
if you want to code along with us.
